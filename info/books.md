# Selected Books for Computer Language Processing

The following books contain overlapping material with some recommendations for most relevant parts:

 * [Modern compiler implementation in ML](http://library.epfl.ch/en/beast?isbn=9781107266391). Read Sections 2.1-2.4 for Lexical analysis, Sections 3.1-3.2 for parsing, and 5.3-5.4 as well as 16.1-16.3 for type checking
  * [Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation](https://epfl.swisscovery.slsp.ch/permalink/41SLSP_EPF/1g1fbol/alma990053993040205516) (3rd Ed.) by Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman, 2007. First seven chapters are an excellent way to get in-depth understanding of finite automata and context-free grammars. If you need to pick, read sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2.3, 4.1, 5.1, 5.2
   * [Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications by Kenneth H. Rosen (8th edition)](https://epfl.swisscovery.slsp.ch/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma99116968862405516&context=L&vid=41SLSP_EPF:prod&lang=en&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=41SLSP_EPF_MyInst_and_CI&query=any,contains,Discrete%20Mathematics%20and%20Its%20Applications&sortby=date_d&facet=frbrgroupid,include,9018235242682604086&offset=0), available in the library and you may have it already. Useful backround is in sections 1.7, 1.8, 2.1, 2.2, 5.1, 5.3, 9.1, 9.2, 13.1, 13.3, 13.4
  * [Basics of Compiler Design](http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~torbenm/Basics/). Online! Read pages 9-88 (omit Section 2.8) for lexical analysis and parsing
  * [Compilers, principle, techniques and tools](http://library.epfl.ch/en/beast?isbn=9781292024349)
