## Schedule and material

Monday slots will typically focus on lecture materials. The remaining slots will focus on labs, **except for the first week's Wednesday and Thursday** when we will have lectures to get basic understanding of the metarial. We will provide an online version of the activity as well. So far, as long as there is demand, the plan is to also be present in the physical room, as scheduled.

The material we cover will be similar to [last year](https://lara.epfl.ch/w/cc20/top).
