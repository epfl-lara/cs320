## Schedule and material

Monday slots will typically focus on lecture materials. The remaining slots will focus on labs, except for the first Wednesday when we will have an introductory lecture. We will provide an online version of the activity as well. So far, as long as there is demand, the plan is to also be present in the physical room as scheduled.

The material we cover will be similar to [last year](https://lara.epfl.ch/w/cc20/top).
