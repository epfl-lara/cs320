# EPFL CS320 - Computer language processing, Spring 2025

[Course Description and Schedule](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/computer-language-processing-CS-320)


## Grading

The grade is based on a midterm (30%) as well as project work (70%) that has many aspects: the implementation in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), a written report, oral presentation, and answers to questions, in presentation and throughout the semester. There will be no written exam. Here is the weight of the milestones in the overall course grade:

  * 30% (see [the archive of past exams](past-exams/))
  * 10% Lab 1
  * 10% Lab 2
  * 10% Lab 3
  * 10% Lab 4
  * 10% Lab 5
  * 20% Lab 6 (Compiler extension, customized)

For the final Lab 6, each group will need to present the project in a slot in one of the last two weeks of the semester. The final report on the project will need to handed in after the end of the semester but the students are encouraged to complete it during the semester.

  * [Modern compiler implementation in ML](http://library.epfl.ch/en/beast?isbn=9781107266391). Read Sections 2.1-2.4 for Lexical analysis, Sections 3.1-3.2 for parsing, and 5.3-5.4 as well as 16.1-16.3 for type checking
  * [Compilers, principle, techniques and tools](http://library.epfl.ch/en/beast?isbn=9781292024349)
