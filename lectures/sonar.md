# Arseniy Zaostrovnykh and Quentin Jaquier: Static analysis for Amy

Compiler technology enables a deep understanding of source code that is useful beyond producing an executable. In this lecture, we will introduce static analysis that powers tools detecting bugs and vulnerabilities in your code. We will present several techniques: AST-based analysis, taint analysis, and symbolic execution. We will demonstrate how static analysis can be implemented for Amy language.
